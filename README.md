# Overview
A ball-centering dribbler is being developed to improve the kicking accuracy of robots. Please refer to [this file](https://github.com/oonchulip97/dribbler/blob/master/Study%20of%20Material%20and%20Design%20of%20Dribbler%20Subsystem.pdf) for more information.

# Future Endeavors
  - Cost
    - Is there a design that is slightly worse but significantly cheaper?
  - Robustness
    - How long the dribbler retain its performance over time?
  - Ease of Manufacturing
    - Is there other techniques to reduce consumption of time of manufacturing?
